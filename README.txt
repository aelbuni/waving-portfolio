This is a free plugin that gives the website owners the capability to elegantly represent their long job achievements in a unified portfolio grid.

== Description ==

This is a free modern plugin with very easy control and display flow that gives website owners the capability to professionally & elegantly promote & represent their long job achievements in a unified good looking portfolio grid.

For placing your portfolio grid anywhere in your website, just use the following shortcode and you are done:
[waving cols="x" /]

Where cols is the number of columns you want your grid to use.

In the portfolio post section you can attach only one custom gallary using the native wordpress media window, and once you add the shortcode of the gallary, make sure to place it inside a hidden div so it doesn't show inside the portfolio content as follow:

[div style="display: none;"]
	[gallery ids="41,42,43,44,45"]
[/div]

Enjoy! And don't forget to rate, and ask for support if you have faced any troubles.

Peace!
